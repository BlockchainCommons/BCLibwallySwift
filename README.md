# BCLibWallySwift

Opinionated Swift wrapper around [LibWally](https://github.com/ElementsProject/libwally-core), a collection of useful primitives for cryptocurrency wallets.

This is a fork of [LibWally Swift](https://github.com/blockchain/libwally-swift). It has a new build system for building a universal XCFramework for use with MacOSX, Mac Catalyst, iOS devices, and the iOS simulator across Intel and Apple Silicon (ARM).

Also supports particular enhancements used by Blockchain Commons from our fork of libwally-core: [bc-libwally-core](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-libwally-core), in the [bc-maintenance](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-libwally-core/tree/bc-maintenance) branch.

## Dependencies

```sh
$ brew install autoconf autogen gsed
```

## Build

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/blockchaincommons/BCLibWallySwift.git
$ cd BCLibWallySwift
$ ./build.sh
```

The resulting frameworks are `build/CLibwally.xcframework` and `build/LibWally.xcframework`. Add both to your project.

## Usage

Derive address from a seed:

```swift
import LibWally

let mnemonic = try! BIP39Mnemonic(words: "abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about")
let masterKey = try! HDKey(seed: mnemonic.seedHex(passphrase: "bip39 passphrase"))
let path = try! BIP32Path(string: "m/44'/0'/0'")
_ = masterKey.fingerprint
let account = try! masterKey.derive(using: path)
_ = account.xpub
_ = account.address(type: .payToWitnessPubKeyHash)
```

Derive address from an xpub:

```swift
let account = try! HDKey(base58: "xpub6ASuArnXKPbfEwhqN6e3mwBcDTgzisQN1wXN9BJcM47sSikHjJf3UFHKkNAWbWMiGj7Wf5uMash7SyYq527Hqck2AxYysAA7xmALppuCkwQ")
let receivePath = try! BIP32Path(string: "0/0")
let key = try! account.derive(using: receivePath)
_ = key.address(type: .payToPubKeyHash) // 1JQheacLPdM5ySCkrZkV66G2ApAXe1mqLj
```

Parse an address:

```swift
let address = try! Address(string: "bc1q6zwjfmhdl4pvhvfpv8pchvtanlar8hrhqdyv0t")
_ = address.scriptPubKey // 0014d09d24eeedfd42cbb12161c38bb17d9ffa33dc77
_ = address.scriptPubKey.type // .payToWitnessPubKeyHash
```

Create and sign a transaction:

```swift
let txId = "400b52dab0a2bb5ce5fdf5405a965394b43a171828cd65d35ffe1eaa0a79a5c4"
let vout: UInt32 = 1
let amount: Satoshi = 10000
let witness = Witness(.payToWitnessPubKeyHash(key.pubKey))
let input = TxInput(Transaction(txId)!, vout, amount, nil, witness, scriptPubKey)!
transaction = Transaction([input], [TxOutput(destinationAddress.scriptPubKey, amount - 110)])
transaction.feeRate // Satoshi per byte
let accountPriv = HDKey("xpriv...")
let privKey = try! accountPriv.derive(BIP32Path("0/0")!)
transaction.sign([privKey])
transaction.description # transaction hex
```
